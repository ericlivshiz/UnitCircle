FEATURES:
A grey line at 0 degrees on the unit circle

Cursor is being tracked--
  one line will show to the end of the circle
  another will go to your mouse

Radial line can either 1.) follow the mouse (unlocked)
or 2.) not follow the mouse (locked)

When a user does 1 thing (either changes degree on unit circle, or changes text box)
the program needs to fill out the rest

  TRIANGLE FAN GENERATOR:
  //////////

  LOCKED-UNLOCK MECHANISM:
  generally:
    bool isLocked;
    if isLocked is true, the users mouse will not be followed
    if isLocked is false, the users mouse will be tracked for input
  
  conditions:
    if a user clicks, isLocked = opposite of what it was before the click
    if the user clicks on a textbox/button, isLocked = true;
    
  light psuedo-code:

  class Lock{
    bool isLocked() {
      return false;
    }    
    
    void flipLock() {
      if (isLocked)
        isLocked = false;  
      if (!isLocked)
        isLocked = true;
    }
    
  }
    
    idk where this stuff should go nothing's built lol, it's floating in space for now
    
    // tracks mouse while unlocked
    if (!Lock.islocked) 
      trackMouse();
    
    // switches from lock-unlock on click
    if (event.type == sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed)
    {
    if (event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Right)
      Lock.flipLock();
    }
    
    if one of the buttons pressed
      isLocked = true;
