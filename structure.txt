FILES:
One for every class

CLASSES:
Lock
Triangle Fan Generator
Unit Circle
Bottom Text
Game (the core)
Math Stuff
Mouse
Degree
Radians
CosSin


METHODS NEEDED:
  Lock:
    bool isLocked();
    void flipLock();
    
  Triangle Fan Generator:
    ////
    ////
  
  Unit Circle:
    // make circle with sfml
    renderer::draw(circle)
    // needs to be able to change based off what is input on Bottom text
    
  Bottom Text:
    ////
    ////
    
  Game:
    // intializes everything needed
    // calls everything needed
    
  Math Stuff:
    // Should contain methods for all math stuff that we need.
    
    // When we need math for something, we should pass values
    // MathStuff.blah(in here, in here), and it should spit
    // out an answer.
    
    // This way we don't have random math written in some method
    
  Mouse:
    float TrackMouse();
    // this will return an x and y position
    
    // needs more
    
    (will be used like this):
    while (!Lock.isLocked)
      Mouse.TrackMouse()
      
      
  WHAT'S CONNECTED:
    Lock->Bottom Text
    // needs to know if one of the bottom text buttons are pressed
    
    Mouse->Lock
    // Mouse will need to know if Lock.isLocked or not
    
    Triangle Fan Generator->Unit Circle, Math Stuff, Renderer
    // all you
    
    Unit Circle->Renderer, Bottom Text
    // circle needs to be drawn
    // needs to be able to change based on bottom text
    
    Bottom Text->Degree, Radians, CosSin
    // needs to be able to fill in the fields
